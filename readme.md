# Discontinued:
The idea was to track followers and following using DOM manipulation, but there’s an issue—when the followers or following modal opens, the numbers aren’t accurate. I couldn’t pinpoint the problem maybe it's on insta end that data is not fetched correctly or shown, so I’ve decided to discontinue the project for now.
