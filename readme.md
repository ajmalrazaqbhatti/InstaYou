## 🤔 FAQ (Because We Know You're Wondering)

> **"Will they know I'm stalking them?"**  
> Absolutely NOT. This is stealth mode. We just read the numbers that are already on the page.

> **"Can I see EXACTLY who unfollowed them?"**  
> Not yet bestie. Instagram's API doesn't allow that without getting blocked. But we show you the counts so you can do the math.

> **"Why isn't it working for some accounts?"**  
> Make sure you're on their main profile page (not their story or post). Refresh if needed.

> **"Is this legal?"**  
> It's literally just looking at numbers that are already public on Instagram. We're not hacking anything, just being organized stalkers.

## 🚫 Troubleshooting When It's Acting Sus

- **Stats Not Showing?** Refresh the page and try again
- **Profile Not Loading?** Make sure you're actually on a profile page
- **Numbers Look Wrong?** Instagram sometimes shows rounded numbers (1.2M instead of 1,234,567) but we convert them properly

## 🗑️ Clearing Your Data

If you want to delete your stored data:
- Click the **InstaYou** icon
- Click **"Spot the Difference 👀"**
- Click the **"Yeet the List 🗑️"** button to delete all stored profiles
- Or delete individual profiles with the delete button next to each name
