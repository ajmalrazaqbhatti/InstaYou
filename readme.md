## 🤔 FAQ (Because We Know You're Wondering)

> **"Will they know I'm stalking them?"**  
> Absolutely NOT. This is stealth mode. Nobody knows except you and the FBI agent watching your screen.

> **"Can I see EXACTLY who unfollowed them?"**  
> Not yet bestie. Instagram's API doesn't allow that without getting blocked. But we show you the counts so you can do the math.

> **"Why isn't it working for some accounts?"**  
> Make sure you're on their main profile page (not their story or post). Refresh if needed. If the tea still won't spill, they might have a weird profile setup.

> **"Is this legal?"**  
> It's literally just looking at numbers that are already public on Instagram. We're not hacking anything, just being organized stalkers.

## 🚫 Troubleshooting For When It's Acting Sus

- **Stats Not Showing?** Refresh the page and try again
- **Profile Not Loading?** Make sure you're actually on a profile page
- **Numbers Look Wrong?** Instagram sometimes shows rounded numbers (1.2M instead of 1,234,567) but we convert them properly
